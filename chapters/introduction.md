## What is Prompting?

Prompting is the process of providing initial text or instructions to an LLM to generate a desired output. Prompting techniques can be used to enhance the quality and relevance of generated outputs.

In other words, it refers to describing the task in the form of natural language sentences.

## Why Prompting?

- Output from the language model depends on the prompt given
- Proper prompt can ensure the output is closer to the given task
- Quality of results depends on the amount of information provided
- Demonstrations allow the model to think

## What is Prompt Engineering?

- relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts
- **Goal**
  - efficiently exploit large language models by varying prompts to achieve desired results
- Helps avoid inconsistency and inaccuracy in results

## Challenges of Prompt Engineering

- Need for domain-specific knowledge
- Interpretability issues
  - Complex prompts
  - Difficult to interpret
